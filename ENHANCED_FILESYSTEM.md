# Enhanced File System Implementation

This document outlines the enhanced file system capabilities that have been added to LLM_MCP_Client based on features from OpenManus.

## Key Features Added

### 1. StrReplaceEditor-inspired Capabilities
- **Precise String Replacement**: Exact string matching with uniqueness validation
- **Line-based Insertion**: Insert content at specific line numbers
- **Line Number Support**: View files with line numbers and selective range viewing
- **Edit History**: Track changes with undo capability

### 2. File Operators Protocol Approach
- **Modular Design**: Clear interface for file operations
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and validation
- **Path Resolution**: Proper handling of paths with workspace containment

### 3. Advanced Directory Operations
- **Directory Viewing**: List contents of directories
- **Directory Creation & Deletion**: Create and delete directories recursively
- **Path Validation**: Ensure paths exist and validation of file vs. directory operations

### 4. Path Safety Features
- **Workspace Containment**: Prevent operations outside of designated workspace
- **Absolute Path Handling**: Proper resolution of paths
- **Path Existence Checking**: Validate paths before operations

### 5. File Metadata Support
- **File Information**: Get detailed metadata about files
- **File Type Detection**: Determine file types and handle appropriately
- **Size Limitation Handling**: Smart handling of large files

### 6. LLM Integration
- **Enhanced Action Types**: New file operation commands:
  - `VIEW`: View file with line numbers and optional range
  - `REPLACE`: Replace specific strings in files
  - `INSERT`: Insert at specific line numbers
  - `UNDO`: Undo last edit
  - `INFO`: Get file metadata
  - `EXISTS`: Check if paths exist
  - `MKDIR`: Create directories
  - `RMDIR`: Delete directories

## Implementation Files

1. `enhanced-filesystem-server.js`: Core implementation of enhanced file operations
2. `enhanced-action-parser.js`: Parser for new action types
3. `enhanced-main.js`: Integration with the application
4. `enhanced-llm-client.js`: Updated system prompt for LLM

## Benefits

1. **More Precise Editing**: Edit specific portions of files without rewriting the entire file
2. **Better Context**: Line numbers and file info provide better context for LLM
3. **Safer Operations**: Path validation and workspace containment prevent errors
4. **Undo Capability**: Track history to undo changes when needed
5. **Enhanced Directory Support**: Better support for working with directories

## Example Usage

```
// View a file with line numbers
[[VIEW: path/to/file.txt]]

// View specific lines
[[VIEW: path/to/file.txt, [10, 20]]]

// Replace a specific string
[[REPLACE: path/to/file.txt, old string, new string]]

// Insert at line number
[[INSERT: path/to/file.txt, 5, new content]]

// Undo last edit
[[UNDO: path/to/file.txt]]

// Get file information
[[INFO: path/to/file.txt]]

// Check if path exists
[[EXISTS: path/to/file.txt]]

// Create directory
[[MKDIR: path/to/directory]]

// Delete directory
[[RMDIR: path/to/directory]]
```

These enhancements significantly improve the precision, safety, and capabilities of file operations in LLM_MCP_Client, bringing it closer to the powerful file handling features found in OpenManus.
